        <h2 class="text-3xl"> "Discuss the scope of var, let, and const"</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">Answer:
        <p>
            The scope of variables in JavaScript, defined by the keywords var, let, and const, plays a crucial role in
            determining how and where a variable can be accessed within a program.
            <br>
            <span class="text-xl">1. var:</span> Variables declared with var have function-level scope. This means that
            they are only scoped to the
            nearest function containing them. If declared outside of a function, they become global variables and are
            accessible throughout the entire program. This can lead to unintended consequences and potential issues with
            variable hoisting, where variables are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope.

            <br>
            <span class="text-xl">2. let: </span> Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let provides block-level scope.
            Variables declared with let are
            confined to the nearest enclosing block, such as a loop or an if statement. This prevents common issues like
            variable hoisting and makes code more predictable. It allows for redeclaration within a different block
            scope.
            <br>

            <span class="text-xl">3. const:</span> Like let, const also has block-level scope. However, it has the added
            constraint of immutability.
            Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set. This makes const ideal
            for declaring constants or values that should remain unchanged.

            In summary, choosing the right variable declaration keyword depends on your needs. var is generally avoided
            due to its function-level and global scope behavior, while let and const offer better scoping control. Use
            let when you need to reassign variables, and const when you want to declare constants or ensure
            immutability. Properly understanding and using variable scope is essential for writing maintainable and
            bug-free JavaScript code.

        <h2 class="text-3xl"> "Tell us the use cases of null and undefined"</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">Answer:</p>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values that are often used to represent the absence or
            lack of a value, but they are used in different contexts and have different use cases.
            <br>
            <span class="text-xl">1. null:</span> Explicitly Indicating the Absence of a Value: One of the primary use
            cases of null is to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no assigned value. It is
            often used when you want to convey that there should be no meaningful value in a particular context.

            Clearing Values: null can be assigned to a variable or object property to clear or reset its value,
            especially in cases where you want to release memory or resources associated with that value.

            <br>
            let data = fetchData(); // Fetch some data.
            // After processing, clear the data when it's no longer needed.
            data = null;
            Function Return Values: Functions can return null to indicate that they did not produce a valid result or
            that the result is unavailable.
            <br>

            function findElement(arr, target) {
            // If the target is not found, return null to indicate absence.
            return null;}
            let user = null; // Represents the absence of a user object.

            nearest function containing them. If declared outside of a function, they become global variables and are
            accessible throughout the entire program. This can lead to unintended consequences and potential issues with
            variable hoisting, where variables are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope.

            <br>
            <span class="text-xl">2. undefined: </span>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Default Function Parameters: When a function parameter is not provided in a function call, it is
                automatically assigned the value undefined. Developers can use this to provide default values or handle
                missing arguments.
                <br>
                <p class="text-bold">javascript</p>

                function greet(name) {
                name = name || 'Guest'; // If name is undefined, use 'Guest' as the default.
                return `Hello, ${name}!`;

        <h2 class="text-3xl"> "What do you mean by REST API?"</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">Answer:</p>
        <p>

            REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an
            architectural style and a set of constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a technology
            itself, but rather a set of principles and constraints that can be applied to web services and other
            distributed systems to make them more scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.
            <br>
            <p class="text-bold">Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
                <li class="mb-2">Statelessness</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Client-Server Architecture</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Uniform Interface</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Resource-Based</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Representation</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Stateless Communication</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Layered System</li>

              </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            RESTful APIs are commonly used in web development and web services because they are simple, easy to
            understand, and can be accessed using standard HTTP libraries and tools. They are widely adopted for
            building APIs that allow different software systems to communicate over the internet.
